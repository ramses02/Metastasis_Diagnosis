# Metastasis_Diagnosis

## Overview

Welcome to the "Precision Cancer Diagnosis" project, where we have developed a robust machine learning model for the classification of histopathologic images extracted from lymph node sections. Our primary goal is to determine the presence of metastatic tissue in these images using advanced deep learning techniques. This project offers a comprehensive analysis of various model architectures, along with code for essential tasks like data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation. We have also provided detailed documentation to help users navigate through the project effectively.

## Business Understanding

Cancer, particularly metastatic cancer, poses a significant threat to human health. Early and accurate detection is crucial for effective treatment and patient outcomes. Traditionally, pathologists analyze histopathologic slides to identify cancerous tissue, a process that is time-consuming and susceptible to human error. By harnessing the power of machine learning models, we aim to streamline this process, leading to faster and more precise cancer diagnoses. Our project addresses the urgent need for automated cancer detection, using the PatchCamelyon dataset to create a benchmark for state-of-the-art machine learning models in the field of histopathology.

## Data Understanding and Exploration 

### The PatchCamelyon Dataset

Our dataset is a comprehensive collection of histopathologic images extracted from lymph node sections, designed for binary classification. It comprises 327,680 high-resolution color images, each measuring 96 x 96 pixels. These images are labeled with binary annotations indicating the presence or absence of metastatic tissue.

### Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project is known as PatchCamelyon (PCam), and it is hosted in the [official PCam GitHub repository](https://github.com/basveeling/pcam). PCam is a valuable resource for machine learning tasks related to image classification, particularly in the field of histopathology.

### Overview

PCam is a comprehensive collection of high-resolution histopathologic images extracted from lymph node sections. Each image measures 96 x 96 pixels and is provided in color. The dataset is designed for binary image classification tasks, where the goal is to determine the presence or absence of metastatic tissue within these images.

### Dataset Size and Labels

- The PCam dataset consists of an impressive 327,680 images.
- These images are labeled with binary annotations, where:
  - '1' indicates the presence of metastatic tissue.
  - '0' indicates the absence of metastatic tissue.

### Data Distribution

- The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets, ensuring proper evaluation and benchmarking.
- It is important to note that there is no overlap in whole-slide images (WSIs) between the splits.
- The dataset has been carefully balanced, with a 50/50 ratio between positive (metastatic) and negative (non-metastatic) examples in each split.

### Image Annotation

- A positive label (1) indicates that the central 32x32-pixel region of a patch contains at least one pixel of tumor tissue.
- Tumor tissue in the outer region of the patch does not influence the label. This outer region is provided to enable the design of fully-convolutional models.

### Patch Selection

- PCam is derived from the Camelyon16 Challenge and contains data from 400 H&E stained WSIs of sentinel lymph node sections.
- Slides were acquired and digitized at two different centers using a 40x objective, resulting in a pixel resolution of 0.243 microns.
- Data sampling methods, including HSV conversion, blurring, and patch selection, were applied to create the patch-based dataset.

This dataset presents a unique and challenging opportunity for machine learning models, and its large size and balanced distribution make it suitable for a wide range of tasks, including deep learning and image classification.

Please refer to the [official PCam repository](https://github.com/basveeling/pcam) for detailed documentation, usage guidelines, and access to the dataset.

## Note on Model Complexity and Memory Limitations


Please be aware that the utilization of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture demands substantial computational resources, even exceeding the capabilities of high-end hardware like the Apple M2 Max chip that was used for this project. Consequently, this repository primarily presents the most pertinent outcomes and highlights essential steps involved in hyperparameter tuning. Comprehensive details of the processes responsible for achieving the performance showcased herein, such as Bayesian Optimization, Grid Searches, and Random Searches, are documented separately in a dedicated, auxiliary notebook. It's noteworthy that these processes, besides their computational demands, can also consume a significant portion of local memory, resulting in a slowdown of the overall process. As a result, after determining the optimal hyperparameters, the cells dedicated to hyperparameter tuning were often entirely removed to optimize memory usage, execution time, and overall performance. Nevertheless, this repository serves as a comprehensive guide for the design of a high-performance CNN model capable of accurately diagnosing cancerous tissue.

## Data Preprocessing

In this project, we've taken several important steps in data preprocessing:

We prepared the target variables (y_train, y_test, and y_valid) for use in deep learning models by converting them to NumPy arrays, changing their data type to float32, and reshaping them into column vectors.
We normalized the pixel values of the images in the dataset to a range of [0.0, 1.0] by dividing each pixel value by 255.0. This normalization process is a standard preprocessing step in deep learning tasks, ensuring that the pixel values are within a consistent and manageable range for neural network training.

## Model Performance and Analysis

Our project includes a detailed analysis of the model's performance on both validation and testing datasets. It's essential to highlight some key findings:

The model exhibits commendable overall accuracy on the testing dataset, demonstrating its ability to make correct predictions.
Precision and recall metrics vary between the two classes ("Normal" and "Metastasis"), indicating a trade-off between minimizing false positives and false negatives.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

### Model Selection 

After rigorous evaluation of various models, it is evident that our selected model has demonstrated exceptional performance in classifying histopathologic images from the PatchCamelyon dataset. It exhibits high precision, effectively distinguishing between the presence and absence of metastatic tissue. Additionally, it maintains a low rate of false positives, a critical factor in medical diagnosis.

### Deployment Recommendations

The consistent excellence exhibited by the model positions it as a strong candidate for integration into clinical settings for the interpretation of lymph node histopathologic images. Healthcare professionals can benefit significantly from its precision, providing valuable insights during the diagnostic process. However, continuous monitoring post-deployment is crucial to ensure that the model maintains its precision and adapts to new data.

## Next Steps

### Data Expansion

To further enhance the robustness and generalization capabilities of the model, it is imperative to expand the dataset. Diversifying the dataset with additional samples and employing data augmentation techniques can expose the model to a broader range of features and variations, ultimately improving its performance.

### Hyperparameter Refinement

Exploring the intricate hyperparameters of the model can unlock even better performance metrics. Techniques such as comprehensive grid search or random search can help identify the optimal combination of hyperparameters, fine-tuning the model for increased accuracy and efficiency, with the help of state-of-the-art machines dedicated to such tasks.

### Transfer Learning Implementation

Considering the limitations of dataset size, integrating pretrained models, such as VGG16, ResNet, or MobileNet, might be beneficial. These models, trained on extensive datasets, can transfer their learned insights to our specific task, potentially enhancing performance even with limited data.

### Clinical Trials

Before full-scale deployment, the model should undergo rigorous testing with a diverse set of histopathologic images in real-world clinical conditions. This process will ensure the model's consistent reliability and validate its applicability in a clinical setting.

### Feedback Integration

Establishing a robust feedback mechanism where clinicians and pathologists can provide feedback and validate the model's predictions is invaluable. This continuous feedback loop will facilitate iterative improvements, refining the model's predictions over time and ensuring its alignment with evolving diagnostic needs in histopathology analysis.

We hope that this project serves as a valuable resource for advancing AI-driven cancer diagnosis and contributes to improving patient outcomes through early and accurate detection. Please feel free to explore the code, documentation, and findings provided in this repository.
